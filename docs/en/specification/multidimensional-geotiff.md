# What is a Multidimensional GeoTIFF?

A **mGeoTIFF** extends the traditional GeoTIFF format by supporting
N-dimensional arrays (similar to NetCDF, HDF5, or Zarr). It retains:

- The simplicity, maturity, and compatibility of the GeoTIFF format.
- Fast access.
- The ability to be opened by GIS software or libraries that support GeoTIFF.
